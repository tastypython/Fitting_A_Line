# Fitting_A_Line
For Loop Exersise



Write code for doing a linear regression in one variable using pure python(IE, no modules).
Linear regression is a method to fit a straight line through a given curve

First, take the values of x and y via user input. How will you take user input for a large number of values without repated code?

Next , use the formula for finding the new values of y. 

Plot the inital x and y, and the new x vs nw y on the  graph(both plots on the same graph for comparison). 
Use matplotlib (Learn how to plot) to make the graphs.

Finally print the covariance, correlation coeffient, and RMSE value.
